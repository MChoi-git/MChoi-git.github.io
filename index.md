# Matthew Choi
### Applied ML specialist - [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/)

Hi I'm Matt! I'm currently working as an applied ML specialist at the Vector Institute in Toronto, Canada. I graduated with a BASc in Biomedical Mechanical Engineering and a BSc in Computing Technology from the University of Ottawa in 2020. 

Although my university experience was rooted in applied mechanics, I've developed a thorough passion for machine learning. My current interests are a combination of optimization, distributed computing, and large language models. 

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out on either [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-choi-bmed/) or via [email](mailto:matthew.choi@vectorinstitute.ai). If you just want to chat, that's fine too!

## Projects
For a full list of personal projects, check out my [github](https://github.com/MChoi-git).

[JAX LLM Scaling - Spring GTC 2023](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/on-demand/session/gtcspring23-s51956/)

[Distributed Language Modelling](https://github.com/MChoi-git/distributed-fun) - Language modelling with [Megatron-LM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.08053.pdf) distributed techniques using both [PyTorch Distributed RPC](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/rpc.html) and [JAX pjit](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax-101/08-pjit.html).

Conditional PATE-GAN - Tabular data generative model with differential privacy. An implementation of the [PATE-GAN](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=S1zk9iRqF7) paper.

[Graph Neural Networks in JAX](https://github.com/MChoi-git/graph_NNs_jax) - Exploratory project into various GNNs using JAX / [Flax](https://github.com/google/flax) / [j-raph](https://github.com/deepmind/jraph).

[Annealed Importance Sampling](https://github.com/MChoi-git/AIS-jax) - Reproduction of results from the AIS [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/9803008) by R. Neal (1998). Really interesting method for Monte-Carlo expectation approximation.  

MetNet-2 - Framework reproduction of the [MetNet-2 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.07470) for spatiotemporal forecasting. This MetNet version includes the usage of ConvLSTMs and dilated convolutions, rather than the original axial attention modules. 

[Passive Lower-Body Exoskeleton](https://github.com/MChoi-git/Exoskeleton-Capstone-Archive) - University capstone project, done using SolidWorks and Matlab. 

More to come!
